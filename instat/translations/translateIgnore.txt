# This file provides a way to ignore specified WinForm controls when the application or dialog is 
# translated into a different language.
# 
# For example, this file can be used to ensure that a specific label's text stays the same, even 
# when the rest of the dialog is translated into French or Portuguese.
# 
# Examples of controls that should be ignored (i.e. never translated) include:
# 
#     - Text that references pre-existing data or meta data (e.g. a file name, data frame name, 
#       column name, cell value etc.)
#     - Text that represents R code (e.g. a variable name, code snippet or a complete 
#       script/statement)
# 
# Each line in this file may represent:
# 
#     - The name of a specific control to ignore. The name must be identical to the name in the 
#       'form_controls.form_name' column in the 'rInstatTranslations.db' database 
#       (e.g. 'dlgAugment_ucrModelReceiver_txtReceiverSingle')
# 
#     - A group of controls to ignore. The group is specified using SQLite pattern matching 
#       (see https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html). Examples (note that the '_' character must be 
#       escaped because otherwise it acts as a wild card):
#         - 'dlgAugment\_%' do not translate any of the controls in the 'dlgAugment' dialog
#         - '%\_txtReceiverSingle' do not translate any text in single receivers
# 
#     - An exclamation point ('!') at the start of the line negates the pattern. Any control in that 
#       pattern that was previously excluded (ignored) becomes included again. 
#       This is similar to negation in the Git ignore file (see https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore 
#       for a deeper explanation of negation).
#       Negation can be useful if you want to ignore a group of controls with a few specific exceptions. 
#       For example, the lines below ignore all the controls in the 'dlgBarChart' dialog apart from 
#       the 'lblTitle' label:
#         'dlgBarChart\_%'
#         '!dlgBarChart\_%\_lblTitle'
#
#     - Blank lines are ignored, they can be used as separators for readability
#
#     - A hash '#' at the start of the line indicates a comment
# 
# 
# Technical note:
# 
# The specifications in this file will be used to construct an SQL command that updates the 
# translation database.
#
# For example, if this file contains:
# 
#     %\_lblModels
#     %\_lblModelpreview
#     !dlgGlance\_%
#     !dlgTidy\_%
# 
# then these lines will be used to construct an SQL command similar to (for conciseness ESCAPE 
# specifications not shown):
# 
#     UPDATE form_controls SET id_text = 'DoNotTranslate' WHERE 
#         (control_name LIKE '%\_lblModels' OR control_name LIKE '%\_lblModelpreview') 
#         AND NOT 
#         (control_name LIKE 'dlgGlance\_%' OR control\_name LIKE 'dlgTidy\_%')
